It will be stated on the file if it doesn't.\r\n\r\n### SSH-COPY-ID\r\n\r\nThis is for copying your public key to a remote server. Saves you time typing password over and over again.\r\n\r\nUpdate: If you are using homebrew, you do not need to download this. Simply install homebrew and do:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbrew install ssh-copy-id\r\n```\r\n\r\nI used this at a time when homebrew was not popular. In case there are still helpful scripts which are not ideal as homebrew formulas, I will add them up here.\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd ~/.ssh/ && ssh-copy-id -i id_rsa.pub user@remoteserver\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BACKUP MYSQL DATABASES\r\n\r\n1. copy and modify linux/backup_mysqldb.sh\r\n2. ssh to remote server\r\n3. copy contents of file to `~/scripts/backups.sh`\r\n4. give proper write permissions to make script executable.\r\n   ``` bash\r\n   chmod a+x ~/scripts/backups.sh\r\n   ```\r\n5. crontab -e\r\n6. Add this if you want to backup database per hour:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   0 0 * * *  ~/scripts/backups.sh\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nOn the server where you store backups, make sure to create the directories (e.g., `mkdir -p ~/backups/database`).\r\n\r\n### BACKUP POSTGRESQL DATABASES\r\n\r\n1. copy and modify linux/backup_postgresqldb.sh\r\n2. ssh to remote server\r\n3. copy contents of file to `~/scripts/backups.sh` and\r\n   ```bash\r\n   chmod a+x ~/scripts/backups.sh\r\n   ```\r\n4. give proper write permissions to make script executable\r\n   ```bash\r\n   chmod a+x ~/scripts/backups.sh\r\n   ```\r\n5. update the .pgpass file on your home directory. This is needed to make sure you can backup the database without entering a password.\r\n   `hostname:port:database:username:password`\r\n6. ```bash\r\n   crontab -e\r\n   ```\r\n7. Add this if you want to backup database per hour:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   0 0 * * *  ~/scripts/backups.sh\r\n   ```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
